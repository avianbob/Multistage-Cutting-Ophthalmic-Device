# Multistage Cutting Ophthalmic Device


*A Modular, High-Speed, Reusable Tool for Vitrectomy Surgery*

---

## Overview

This repository contains the design, documentation, and supporting files for a **Rotary Multistage Vitrectomy Cutter** — a novel surgical device for improved retinal surgery outcomes. Unlike conventional guillotine cutters, this device utilizes a **concentric rotary blade system** powered by a single motor, resulting in cleaner and faster tissue removal.
